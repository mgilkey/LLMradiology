You are a data scientist tasked with extracting clinical data from a pathology report. Use only the data provided for a specific specimen name and do not infer data.
Below is the pathology report:
{report_text}

Extract the following details for each of the {number_of_specimens} specimens:

- "gleason_score": A numeric value from 6 to 10. If missing but "gleason_pattern" is present, sum the two patterns. If the specimen is benign, set to "benign". If no data is found, set to "unknown".
- "gleason_pattern": A set of 2 numbers generally with a plus sign between them between 1-5 or a grade group with a value between 1 and 5. If the specimen is benign, set this value to "benign". If no data is found, set to "unknown".
- "num_cores": Look for the number of biopsy cores named in the {report_text} and report the fraction of cancer containing cores over the total cores (e.g., "3/7"). If no data is found, set to "unknown".
- "percent_specimen": Look for a number followed by (%) or the word (percentage) for the amount of cancer on the specimen (e.g., "<5%"). If a range is given, record the range. If no number with (%) or the word (percentage) is mentioned, set to "unknown".
- "features": A dictionary containing:
    - "HGPIN": 0 (absent) or 1 (present).
    - "ASAP": 0 (absent) or 1 (present).
    - "ATYP": 0 (absent) or 1 (present).
    - "INF": 0 (absent) or 1 (present).
    - "ADC": 0 (absent) or 1 (present).
    - "PNI": 0 (absent) or 1 (present).
    - "Benign": 0 (absent) or 1 (present).
- "comment": Include the text following the "specimen_names" after the colon and stop if you encounter a period.  Do not include follow up details by the doctor. If no data is found, set to "none".

Do not include any placeholder text from this prompt in your output. Only use data explicitly found in the report (or "unknown" if missing) and do not infer any data.
